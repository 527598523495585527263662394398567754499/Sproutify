# üß† How it works
Sproutify uses artist-related search terms to locate small public playlists, checks that your artist is actually in the tracklist, and follows the playlist‚Äôs creator‚Äîrespecting rate limits and pacing requests to blend in naturally.
# ‚ú® Customization
Tweak any of the following options in `CONFIG`:
```
"artist_list": ["SZA", "Jhen√© Aiko", "Sonder"],         # Artists to search for
"pages": 5,                   # How deep to search per query
"max_followers": 5,           # Only follow users with fewer than this
"delay_range": (2.5, 6.0),    # Delay between requests
"shuffle_artists": True
```
